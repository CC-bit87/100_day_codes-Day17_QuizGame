# 100_day_codes-Day17_QuizGame
This Python program is a fun and engaging text-based Quiz Game.

Starting with a selection of trivia questions from a predefined data set, the program constructs a quiz bank. Each question comes with a corresponding correct answer. As the game starts, the program cycles through the bank, presenting each question to the player one at a time.

For every question, the player's response is captured and checked against the correct answer. If the player is correct, their score is incremented. The game continues until all questions in the bank have been asked.

At the end of the game, a completion message is displayed along with the player's final score. This is a great way to test your trivia knowledge and see how much you know!
